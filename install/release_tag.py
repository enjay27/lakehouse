"""Release tags (ADR-080, ADR-051): their names, the checks a candidate reads, and the notes.

A release is the tag `platform-YYYY.MM.DD`, `.N` appended (from 2) for a later release the
same day. A candidate of it is `platform-YYYY.MM.DD-rc.N` on the `main` commit Candidate was
started on (a run on refs/heads/main only, plan section 9 of agent-config), with the
branch `rc/<rc tag>` for Promote to run from; a candidate tag is never a release, so a date with
only candidates is still free. The gates upgrade from the latest release the commit they test
contains (gates/gate.py).

Usage:
  python3 install/release_tag.py previous [TAG...]
      prints the latest release among TAGS, or nothing.
  python3 install/release_tag.py next YYYY-MM-DD [TAG...]
      prints the name of the next release on that date.
  python3 install/release_tag.py rc FINAL [TAG...]
      prints the next candidate tag of the release FINAL.
  python3 install/release_tag.py check-main REF
      exits 1 unless REF is refs/heads/main (GITHUB_REF of a Candidate run).
  python3 install/release_tag.py checks-passed RUN_ID
      reads a commit's check runs (the API's JSON) on stdin; exits 1 with the problems unless
      all finished, none failed and static succeeded, leaving out run RUN_ID's own jobs and
      the candidate workflows' jobs.
  python3 install/release_tag.py should-candidate
      prints true when HEAD carries no platform-* tag (final or candidate) and has at least one
      commit since the latest release (every commit when there is none); else false, the
      reason on stderr ("nothing to release" at the release's own commit).
  python3 install/release_tag.py check-promote RC_TAG [TAG...]
      prints the final tag; exits 1 unless RC_TAG is the highest candidate of a release that
      does not exist yet and is above the latest release.
  python3 install/release_tag.py rc-branch BRANCH
      prints the rc tag of a branch rc/<rc tag>.
  python3 install/release_tag.py superseded RC_TAG [BRANCH...]
      prints the rc/ branches among BRANCHES of RC_TAG's release below it.
  python3 install/release_tag.py released FINAL [BRANCH...]
      prints the rc/ branches among BRANCHES of FINAL's release and every older one.
  python3 install/release_tag.py notes TAG COMMIT PREVIOUS|- BRANCH CHECK_RUNS_JSON LOG_FILE
      prints the candidate's release notes; LOG_FILE holds one commit per line since PREVIOUS.
      The log batch's image is named with DIGEST_PLACEHOLDER for its digest, which the
      candidate workflow's tag job replaces with the digest its image job pushed or found
      (ADR-042, ADR-080).
