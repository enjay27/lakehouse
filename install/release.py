"""Installs a release of this repository in the order of ADR-029.

0. Preconditions, checked, never installed: the CloudNativePG `Cluster` CRD is present and the
   operator in `NS_CNPG_SYSTEM` runs a version this release supports (install/supported.json);
   the Barman Cloud Plugin's `ObjectStore` CRD is present and the plugin runs in
   `NS_CNPG_SYSTEM`: its Service, labelled as CNPG finds plugins, has a ready pod (ADR-043).
   On the target clusters the operator and the plugin are the operator team's; on the gate,
   gates/gate.py installs them first.
1. Polaris, in `NS_CATALOG_POLARIS`, then Datahub, in `NS_CATALOG_DATAHUB` (ADR-045). Their
   Secrets come first (scripts/init_env.py --apply-secrets, ADR-006). The gates run this same
   script (ADR-038).
   a. Its PostgreSQL: the `Cluster` polaris-pg from charts/polaris-postgres (ADR-008,
      ADR-010), installed with helm and waited on until Ready, then until it reads healthy
      several times in a row, since a change can restart its instances; once, when the
      upgrade left its spec unchanged (its generation the same). Its backups go to
      `POLARIS_BACKUP_BUCKET` on `S3_ENDPOINT` with the key in `polaris-backup-s3` (ADR-043).
   b. The S3 endpoint and the policy endpoint from `.env` must answer, asked from Polaris's
      namespace by one short-lived curl pod (install/images.json): any HTTP status is an
      answer, no connection is not (ADR-029, ADR-031). It runs with --dry-run too.
   c. The bootstrap (ADR-026): Polaris's admin tool, in a short-lived pod, creates the schema,
      the realm and its root principal from the `polaris-root` Secret. A realm already
      bootstrapped is kept.
   d. The claim polaris-logs (ADR-036): ReadWriteMany, its storage class (which must exist)
      and size from `.env`, applied outside any Helm release so an uninstall keeps the logs.
   e. Polaris 1.6.0 from charts/polaris (ADR-009), with values-lakehouse.yaml and the values
      from `.env` (the database host, the policy endpoint, and the console's origin, allowed
      by CORS only while the console is enabled), waited on until rolled out. Its pods write
      their log files to the claim.
   f. Datahub's network policies (ADR-048 §4, ADR-066 §4, ADR-071 §5):
      charts/datahub-network-policies, default deny in its namespace, each store and GMS open
      to their labelled clients, datahub-pg to the operator, GMS to the emitters' namespaces and
      the frontend to the ingress controller's, from `.env`.
   g. Datahub's PostgreSQL: the `Cluster` datahub-pg from charts/datahub-postgres (ADR-066),
      asynchronous, waited on as polaris-pg is. Its backups go to `DATAHUB_BACKUP_BUCKET` on
      `S3_ENDPOINT` with the key in `datahub-backup-s3`.
   h. Datahub's Kafka: the StatefulSet datahub-kafka from charts/datahub-kafka (ADR-068), one
      KRaft broker, waited on until rolled out and ready.
   i. Datahub's OpenSearch: the StatefulSet datahub-opensearch from upstream's chart in
      charts/datahub-opensearch with its values-lakehouse.yaml (ADR-070), one node, waited on
      until rolled out and ready.
   j. Datahub (ADR-071 §7): its four Secrets from init-env read for their key names, then
      upstream's chart in charts/datahub with its values-lakehouse.yaml, through helm's --wait:
      the blocking system-update Job completes before GMS and the frontend start, both are
      ready, and the non-blocking Job completes. An empty DATAHUB_EMITTER_NAMESPACE_LABEL is
      said, not a problem.
2. After every service of step 1 (ADR-029, ADR-037):
   a. The log batch (ADR-036): charts/polaris-log-batch with the image built from this
      checkout (batch_image), pulled from `IMAGE_REGISTRY` or, when it is empty, the GitHub
      Container Registry the release workflow pushes it to (ADR-042); then the CronJob read
      back to check it runs that image. Its failure stops the install.
   b. The console, when `POLARIS_CONSOLE_ENABLED=true` (ADR-028): charts/polaris-console with
      its values-lakehouse.yaml and the URL at which the browser reaches Polaris, waited on
      until rolled out. A maintainer tool, never part of how Polaris operates: its problems
      are printed and the install still passes.

With --dry-run, the helm upgrades are server-side dry-runs, the bootstrap does not run and
nothing waits: the dry-run gate (ADR-038).

Settings come from `.env` at the repository root, then the environment, which wins. Every
kubectl and helm call names `$KUBE_CONTEXT` (no default, ADR-004) and its namespace (ADR-007).
Needs kubectl and helm.

`batch-image` prints the batch's image on the GitHub Container Registry, whatever `.env` says:
the image the release workflow pushes (ADR-042).

Usage: python3 install/release.py [--dry-run] | batch-image
       Exits 0 when every step passed, 1 with the problems, 2 on an unknown option.
