"""The kind gate (ADR-017, ADR-029, ADR-038): pinned tools, the cluster, the CNPG operator.

  tools BIN_DIR [NAME...]
                  downloads kind, kubectl, helm and kubeconform (or only the NAMEs) from
                  gates/pins.json into BIN_DIR, each checked against its pinned sha256 before
                  anything is written.
  up              creates the kind cluster (one control-plane, two workers, the pinned node
                  image), lets the control-plane take pods, so three nodes hold the three
                  PostgreSQL instances apart, then installs the CNPG operator from its pinned
                  chart archive into NS_CNPG_SYSTEM and waits for it. The operator exists here
                  only because the gate has no operator team (ADR-029); a release never
                  installs it. After it, cert-manager and the Barman Cloud Plugin from their
                  pinned release manifests, the plugin in NS_CNPG_SYSTEM, each waited for
                  (ADR-043). Before CNPG, kind's local-path-provisioner gets the class
                  `shared` on a runner directory every node mounts: ReadWriteMany for the
                  log claim (ADR-036).
  secrets [--direct]
                  writes `.env` for the gate (its context, the stand-ins' endpoints and
                  the S3 stand-in's four keys, Polaris's, the smoke tests' and each
                  PostgreSQL's backups', which are the gate's own, ADR-031, ADR-043, ADR-066),
                  then runs
                  scripts/init_env.py --apply-secrets (ADR-006). Refuses an existing `.env`.
                  With --direct, for a stress install (ADR-053 §4), the endpoints name
                  SeaweedFS, OPA and polaris-pg's read-write service, never the recorder.
  standins        applies the stand-ins (gates/standins.py: SeaweedFS for S3, OPA with
                  gates/opa/policy.rego) in NS_STANDINS and waits for them (ADR-031), then
                  creates the backup buckets, Polaris's and Datahub's, in SeaweedFS and checks
                  them (ADR-043, ADR-066). Never
                  part of a release; the install's endpoint check needs them on the gate.
                  With them the recorder (ADR-034), with a TLS certificate made here, and
                  Prometheus loading docs/contracts/polaris-prometheus-scrape.yaml (ADR-046).
                  `standins --direct`: SeaweedFS and OPA also take connections from Polaris's
                  namespace and run under the CPU limits in gates/stress/config.json, or in
                  the overlay STRESS_OVERLAY names (Tier D's capacity.json, ADR-053 §7).
  check-standins  runs gates/check_standins.sh in a short-lived curl pod in Polaris's namespace:
                  an S3 round trip with Polaris's credentials, and every case of
                  gates/opa/cases.json against the policy endpoint (ADR-026, ADR-031); then
                  gates/check_db.sh in a pod on Polaris's PostgreSQL image: a login as Polaris
                  with and without TLS, a row written and read. All through the recorder.
  check-traffic FILE...
                  reads every record the recorder wrote and matches them against each
                  expectation file (gates/expectations/*.json, gates/traffic.py): exchanges that
                  must have happened and ones that must not (ADR-034). Prints counts, never a body.
  install [--fresh] [--dry-run]
                  installs the latest release HEAD contains (released_tags) from a checkout of
                  its tag, with the gate's `.env` copied into it, runs `seed` over it, then
                  this commit's release over it (ADR-051); with no tag, or with
                  --fresh, only this commit's release. With --dry-run, this commit's release is
                  a server-side dry-run over the installed one (ADR-038). Prints which it did,
                  then the image pulls since it started, from the kubelet's Pulled events:
                  each image's pulls and nodes, and the busiest node's pull time against the
                  install's (#125). Then, unless a dry-run alone installed nothing, its
                  timeline read back from Helm and the cluster: each Helm revision (a step of
                  release.py starts there), Job, rolled-out Deployment and Ready CNPG Cluster
                  since it started, with each of its own commands and the events of Jobs and
                  CNPG Clusters, which outlive the initdb and join Jobs CNPG deletes, and of
                  release.py's endpoint-check and bootstrap pods and log claim (#125). A
                  measurement that fails says so and never fails it.
  seed            writes known data through the last release's Polaris before the upgrade
                  (ADR-051 §2): gates/seed.py in a short-lived pod on the pinned Python image,
                  mounted with iceberg/smoke.py and its hashed requirements from the ConfigMap
                  migration-seed, as root and as gate_seed (principals, roles, grants, a
                  catalog, nested namespaces, tables over two snapshots and a schema change, a
                  view, a policy attached three ways), then gates/db_counts.sh in a pod on
                  Polaris's PostgreSQL image counts each table of polaris_schema and reads the
                  schema version, as Polaris, straight to polaris-pg. What seed.py read back
                  and the counts are kept on the runner in SEED_RECORD, never printed: they
                  hold the seeded principals' credentials. `install` runs it between the two
                  releases, only when it upgrades for real.
  check-migration after the upgrade (ADR-051 §3): seed.py, given the record on stdin, reads
                  every seeded object back with every recorded field and value (a field the
                  new version adds is listed), gets each seeded principal a token, reads each
                  table at each recorded snapshot and appends; then no table of polaris_schema
                  may have fewer rows than recorded, and the schema version before and after is
                  printed. Without a record, a fresh install: it says so and passes.
  rebuild-replica deletes one replica of polaris-pg, never the primary: its PVC without waiting,
                  then its pod. CNPG makes a new instance through a join pod that clones the
                  primary under the network policies; it passes once a new join Job ran and the
                  Cluster is Ready with all its instances, within REBUILD_TIMEOUT s. On failure,
                  the join pods' logs (ADR-048 §7). Gate only: it deletes a volume.
  check-polaris-pg
                  compares the running `Cluster` polaris-pg with the values its helm release
                  was installed with, its shutdown timeout and synchronous replication among
                  them (ADR-056), and checks its instances run on different nodes (ADR-016).
                  When the values turn on failoverQuorum, its `FailoverQuorum` object must
                  report quorum over `number` standbys (ADR-058 §3).
  check-datahub-pg
                  compares the running `Cluster` datahub-pg with the values its helm release
                  was installed with, requires it asynchronous with every instance ready on
                  its own node, then switches WAL on its primary and waits until the segment
                  is archived through the plugin, then takes an on-demand `Backup` and waits
                  until it completes (ADR-066 §5).
  check-datahub-kafka
                  from a short-lived pod in Datahub's namespace with Kafka's client label (never
                  the check label) and the image datahub-kafka's helm release runs: creates a
                  topic, produces a 4.5 MiB message and consumes it back unchanged; deletes the
                  broker's pod, waits until a new one is ready, and reads the message again from
                  its volume; deletes the topic (ADR-068 §5). The check pod is deleted whatever
                  happened.
  check-datahub-opensearch
                  from a short-lived pod in Datahub's namespace with OpenSearch's client label
                  (never the check label) and the image datahub-opensearch's helm release runs:
                  over plain HTTP without credentials, creates an index with one shard and no
                  replica, waits for it to be green, writes one document and finds it by search;
                  deletes the node's pod, waits until a new one is ready, and finds the index
                  green and the document again on its volume; deletes the index (ADR-070 §5).
                  The check pod is deleted whatever happened.
  check-datahub   both system-update Jobs completed (ADR-071 §8); then gates/datahub/check.py in
                  a short-lived pod on the pinned Python image, in Datahub's namespace with GMS's
                  client label (never the check label), as the system client: GMS answers
                  /health, a dataset written is read back by its URN and found by search within
                  DATAHUB_SEARCH_SECONDS, then hard-deleted; then the same script from a pod in
                  the gate's ingress-class namespace, which it creates if missing (ADR-072 §4):
                  the frontend signs in `datahub` with the password in datahub-root-user and
                  refuses `datahub:datahub`. Each credential is read from its Secret and sent
                  on the pod's stdin, never printed or put on a command line.
  check-polaris   compares the running Polaris (its Deployment, pods and ConfigMap) with the
                  values its helm release was installed with and with `.env`, checks its
                  replicas run on different nodes (ADR-016), then runs gates/check_polaris.sh
                  in a short-lived curl pod: ready, a token for root, and each pod accepting
                  it (ADR-026).
  console-image   builds the Polaris console's image (ADR-028): apache/polaris-tools fetched at
                  the commit in images/polaris-console/source.json and checked, its console/ as
                  the context with this repository's package-lock.json, built with
                  images/polaris-console/Dockerfile, then loaded into the kind cluster.
                  --build stops before the load and needs no cluster, so smoke runs it while
                  kind starts; --load loads the image it built.
  batch-image     builds the log batch's image from images/polaris-log-batch, tagged as
                  install/release.py names it, and loads it into the kind cluster (ADR-036).
  check-logs      follows traffic to the hand-off (ADR-024, ADR-036): gates/logs_traffic.sh in
                  a short-lived curl pod makes the catalog gate_logs on the S3 endpoint, then
                  sends each Polaris pod reads with root's token, requests without one, a 400,
                  a 404 and a table made, each with its own X-Request-ID; a Job from the
                  batch's CronJob runs with its clock past that hour, then again; a stand-in
                  Fluent Bit (pinned, the claim read-only) reads processed-logs/ and
                  aggregated-logs/. Every line and row it read must hold contract v2
                  (gates/contract.py) and every summary's books balance; each refused request
                  must be kept once from its pod, no read kept but all counted on the rows; the
                  policy's rules on Polaris's own lines: the 404s dropped with their
                  application lines (3'), the 400s and the catalog made kept with theirs (2b),
                  each commit counted on its table's row (2a); both pods' files read; the second
                  run must change no file.
  check-console   runs gates/console/check.py (on stdin) in a short-lived pod on the pinned
                  Python image: the console answers and points the browser at Polaris, and
                  gate_maintainer signs in as the browser does, from the console's origin,
                  lists the catalogs and is refused a write (ADR-028, ADR-026).
  check-iceberg   runs gates/iceberg/smoke.py in a short-lived pod on the pinned Python image,
                  mounted with its hashed requirements from the ConfigMap iceberg-smoke: PyIceberg
                  as gate_smoke, with the smoke tests' own S3 key (Secret smoke-s3), writes a
                  table into gate_catalog on the S3 endpoint and reads it back, and the policy
                  endpoint refuses what the gate's policy does not grant (ADR-026, ADR-031).
  check-restore   proves a restore (ADR-043 §4): an on-demand `Backup` of polaris-pg through
                  the Barman Cloud Plugin, waited for until completed; then a WAL switch on
                  polaris-pg's primary, waited for until archived, since a backup from a
                  standby is consistent only past it (#86); then the `Cluster`
                  polaris-pg-restore, one instance bootstrapped from the ObjectStore
                  polaris-backup, its base backup and archived WAL to the latest, waited for
                  until Ready, read with its full-recovery Job's pods every few seconds: each
                  failed pod's logs printed as soon as it fails, before CNPG deletes it, then
                  every pod seen, when it ran and how it ended (#86); then healthy on several
                  reads in a row, past CNPG's restart after the recovery; then
                  gates/check_restore.sh in a pod on
                  Polaris's PostgreSQL image reads from it, as Polaris, the realm's root
                  principal and gate_catalog.
                  polaris-pg-restore is deleted whatever happened.

  gate-policies   applies the gate's own allow policies in Polaris's namespace (gates/network.py,
                  ADR-048 §5): the check pods, labelled lakehouse-gate/check, reach every pod;
                  the PostgreSQL recorder reaches the CNPG instances on 5432. `install` runs
                  it before the first release it installs for real: the last release, or this
                  commit's when there is none to upgrade from.
  check-network   creates a namespace per caller class with the gate's label, one without any
                  label and Datahub's, then from a short-lived pod in each, from an
                  unlabelled pod in Polaris's namespace, and from a pod with CNPG's join label
                  in Polaris's namespace and in the unlabelled one, all at once, connects to
                  each target of gates/network.py's CASES: each allowed one must connect, each
                  refused one must time out or be reset (ADR-048 §6). One that should be
                  refused and connects means the cluster does not enforce NetworkPolicy.
                  polaris-pg's exporter on 9187 is reached through a Service the gate adds
                  (ADR-046 §4).
  check-metrics   asks the Prometheus stand-in, from a check pod, until every target is up:
                  `up` 1 for every running Polaris pod and polaris-pg instance, Polaris's
                  http_server_requests_seconds_count above 0, cnpg_collector_up 1 on every
                  instance (gates/metrics.py, ADR-046 §5). On a problem, every target with
                  its last error.
Every kubectl and helm call names the gate's context, and a namespace where the object has
one. Nothing here reaches any cluster but the kind cluster it creates (ADR-017).
