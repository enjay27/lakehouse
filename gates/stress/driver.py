"""The stress run's driver (ADR-053 §2, §4; ADR-054): on the gate's kind cluster with a stress
install (`gate.py up`, `secrets --direct`, `batch-image`, `standins --direct`,
`install --fresh`), it seeds the tables, runs k6 step by step, and checks the result. Every
file it keeps goes under OUT, which stress.yml uploads.

  seed OUT        applies the ConfigMap `stress` (seed.py, smoke.py and its hashed
                  requirements, scenario.js, the config the driver runs with) in Polaris's
                  namespace; runs seed.py in a short-lived pod on the pinned Python image (the
                  check label, root's credentials, the smoke tests' S3 key); puts its tables
                  into the ConfigMap as tables.json; records the config, the restarts of
                  Polaris's and polaris-pg's containers, and polaris-pg's primary and the
                  time; starts the long-lived k6 pod (pinned, the check label, the CPU limit
                  in config.json) and waits until it is ready; records Polaris's replicas,
                  resources and heap maximum.
  ramp PROFILE OUT
                  first waits until Polaris is Ready with no restart for settle.seconds (a
                  ramp's last step can overload Polaris until its liveness probe restarts
                  it, #179); then runs PROFILE's steps (config.json), one k6 run per step at
                  one rate, until a step fails. Each step records when it ran and any
                  restart of Polaris or polaris-pg in it; a step after which Polaris
                  cannot be read fails, after the same wait. Around each step it reads every node's cAdvisor
                  through the API server (the CPU of k6, OPA, SeaweedFS, Polaris and
                  polaris-pg, and how often the three limited ones were throttled) and
                  Polaris's /q/metrics on 8182 from the k6 pod. A step passes when k6
                  dropped at most 5% of the requests offered, at most 0.1% failed (409s on
                  the hot set not counted) and each kind's p99 is within its cap. The knee is
                  the last step that passed; a knee decided while k6, OPA or SeaweedFS was
                  throttled over the max is that component's, and the profile is not a
                  measurement of Polaris.
  hold OUT        after the same wait, the mixed profile at 70% of its knee for 10 minutes;
                  skipped, and said so, when the mixed profile did not run or found no knee.
                  Every sample_seconds
                  while it runs, it samples Polaris's heap, heap after GC, GC pauses and
                  worker queue, and each container's CPU and working set.
  verify OUT      fails the run on a correctness fault only (ADR-054 §2): a 5xx or any other
                  failed request, a 409 on the hot set aside, in a step at or below the knee
                  or in the hold (the step past the knee is where the load fails requests, so
                  it is left out); a commit answered 200 missing from its table's snapshots,
                  a snapshot the scenario never had answered 200 nor left unknown (a commit
                  logged as sent with no outcome, cut short when its step ended, is unknown), or one
                  listed twice (seed.py verify loads every table); a restart or replacement
                  of a Polaris or polaris-pg pod. It also records each table's load in bytes
                  after the seed and after the run, and, without judging, whether
                  polaris-pg's primary changed since the seed and how often its instances'
                  readiness probe failed: CNPG demotes a primary inside its container, so a
                  failover under load restarts no container, and the restart check misses it.
  report OUT [BASELINE]
                  writes summary.json and summary.md (printed too) from what OUT holds: each
                  profile's knee and steps, Polaris's and polaris-pg's CPU per request at
                  it, the sizing for 12,000 req/s from the mixed knee (ADR-053 §7), the
                  hold's percentiles and samples, the tables' growth, verify's result and,
                  with BASELINE (an earlier run's OUT), each knee's and the hold's p99's
                  change. Speed is reported, never judged.
  timeline OUT    writes timeline.json: the Prometheus stand-in's series (ADR-046) for
                  Polaris's load, latency, CPU, heap and GC, and polaris-pg's waits, over the
                  window the steps and the hold ran in, as evidence beside the results.

STRESS_OVERLAY names an overlay on config.json (gate.stress_config): Tier D's is
gates/stress/capacity.json, run by hand from docs/runbooks/stress-capacity.md (ADR-053 §7).

Every kubectl call names the gate's context, and a namespace where the object has one. Nothing
here reaches any cluster but the kind cluster (ADR-017).
