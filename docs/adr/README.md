# lakehouse: Architecture Decision Records

The decisions this repository is built from (ADR-001). Nothing outside `docs/adr/` is trusted
until an ADR covering it is Accepted. See [ADR-000](000-adr-process-and-template.md) for how
these records are written and changed.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Accepted** | Decided. Build on it. |
| **Accepted (details proposed)** | The core decision is made; some details inside are still suggestions. |
| **Proposed** | Suggested, not yet confirmed. Confirm, change, or reject before building on it. |
| **Deferred** | Decided to decide later; recorded so nobody builds around an assumption. |
| **Rejected** | Dropped. Kept for history so that it is not proposed again. |
| **Superseded by ADR-NNN** | Replaced. Kept for history. |
| **Amended by ADR-NNN** | Still in force, except the part that ADR-NNN replaces. Read both. |

## Not ADRs

- **Measurements and their numbers:** `docs/measurements/`, with their evidence (ADR-003).
- **What is next:** labelled issues (ADR-003).
- **How to run something:** runbooks in `docs/runbooks/`, one per procedure, used on a target
  cluster only once proven on a Linux test cluster.
- **Tuning values** (window sizes, caps, replica counts): values files and their comments.
