"""gate-check (ADR-039): a platform PR passes only when passing dry-run and smoke runs cover its
head.

1. Fails if the head branch starts with `gate/`.
2. Passes if the PR changes no platform file (PLATFORM below).
3. Otherwise, for each gate (GATES below: dry-run on `gate/dry-run/<task>`, smoke on
   `gate/smoke/<task>`), takes the latest successful run of its workflow on its branch and that
   run's commit X.
4. Passes only if, for every gate, X is an ancestor of the head and every file changed since X
   is `*.md`. The gates may cover the head from different commits.
5. Prints which commits and runs it relied on; the workflow adds it to the job summary.

`<task>` is the head branch without its first segment: `claude/<task>` (ADR-038), and the
same for Kade's own branches (`kade/x` -> `x`); a branch without `/` is its own task.

Usage:
  python3 gate_check.py --gate-branch HEAD_BRANCH
      prints each gate's branch, one per line: `gate/dry-run/<task>`, `gate/smoke/<task>`.
  python3 gate_check.py HEAD_BRANCH BASE_SHA HEAD_SHA RUNS_JSON [REPO_DIR]
      RUNS_JSON is `GET /repos/{repo}/actions/runs?branch=<gate branch>` for each gate branch,
      merged (the object or its `workflow_runs` list); REPO_DIR holds the PR head with full
      history. Exits 0 on pass, 1 on fail.
